          <p>
            I am currently a Master's student (2022-24) at <a href="https://www.hiof.no/">Østfold University College</a> and a summer Intern (2023) at <a href="https://www.oslomet.no/en/about/employee/stenic/">OsloMet University</a>, Norway. My research focus belongs to ALife, Evolution, Complexity and Artificial General Intelligence. I enjoy working with Prof <a href="https://www.nichele.eu/">Stefano Nichele</a> (also supervisor) where we together study complexity and emergent behaviour in discrete Cellular Automata, continuous CA (Lenia) and Neural CA. Some of my previous work and projects also determine my interest in Deep Learning for Computer Vision and Explainable AI. I finished my Junior Research Fellowship (and did not continue PhD) at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Jodhpur (2020-2022) where I studied Deep Learning, Classical ML, and Dependable AI taught by Dr. <a href="http://home.iitj.ac.in/~mvatsa/">Mayank Vatsa</a> and Dr. <a href="http://home.iitj.ac.in/~richa/">Richa Singh</a>. Conversely, I was also part of <a href="https://vanets-iitj.github.io/pages/people.html">VANETs lab</a> supervised by Prof <a href="https://research.iitj.ac.in/researcher/debasis-das-2">Debasis Das</a>, where my focus was to provide Machine Learning edge for the team. Moreover, I was part of <a href="https://iitj.ac.in/qic/">QIC group</a> at the IIT as well. I finished my early Computer Science Engineering (Bachelor's 2015-2019) degree from <a href="https://www.upes.ac.in/">UPES, Dehradun</a> at the foothills of Himalayas. Most of my guidance during bachelor's for which I am thankful, always to Dr <a href="https://www.ravitomar.in/">Ravi Tomar</a>. I belong to the central part of India, from a town called Banswara which lies in south Rajasthan.

There is an increasing challenge when the water is saline with granular particles and impurities. In such natural adversarial environment, traditional approaches like CNN start to fail and are expensive to compute. This project involves implementing and evaluating various object detection models, including EfficientDet, YOLOv5, YOLOv8, and Detectron2, on an existing annotated underwater dataset, called the Brackish-Dataset. The dataset comprises annotated image sequences of fish, crabs, starfish, and other aquatic animals captured in Limfjorden water with limited visibility. The aim of this research project is to study the efficiency of newer models on the same dataset and contrast them with the previous results based on accuracy and inference time. Firstly, I compare the results of YOLOv3 (31.10% mean Average Precision (mAP)), YOLOv4 (83.72% mAP), YOLOv5 (97.6%), YOLOv8 (98.20%), EfficientDet (98.56% mAP) and Detectron2 (95.20% mAP) on the same dataset. Secondly, I provide a modified BiSkFPN mechanism (BiFPN neck with skip connections) to perform complex feature fusion in adversarial noise which makes modified EfficientDet robust to perturbations. Third, analyzed the effect on accuracy of EfficientDet (98.63% mAP) and YOLOv5 by adversarial learning (98.04% mAP). Last, I provide class activation map based explanations (CAM) for the two models to promote Explainability in black box models. Overall, the results indicate that modified EfficientDet achieved higher accuracy with five-fold cross validation than the …')">
